					<h2>The Idea</h2>

					<p>We were approached by a client who were unhappy with their current system provider. They wanted us to create a new Timesheet and Time Off system for them. Their current system did not allow for them to track expenses. This was a module that our company felt was a natural fit to add. In addition, we wanted to make the system so it could be used by other companies should the oppurtunity arise.</p>

					<p>Being the only Web Developer at the firm, I was in charge of the project. <strong>I hand coded the application using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL</strong>. A lot of the technology and techniques were was new to me, but I learned a lot along the way, and delivered a product that the customer was overjoyed with.</p>

					<h2>Server Setup</h2>
					<p>The first challenge came with the server setup. Unlike most websites I had worked on in the past, Synkros was not suited for shared hosting. I need to have full control over the server so that I could easily configure it to fit my needs. The biggest need for this was to configure the <strong>virtual host file</strong>. The idea was that since this was intended to be a SaaS application, each client would have their own subdomain. To accomplish this, I needed to configure <strong>Wildcard hosts</strong>.</p><br>

					<h2>Structure and Administration</h2>
					<p>After a lot of research, I found the best way to develop the application was to have <strong>one codebase, and a database for each client</strong>. This would allow for easier updates to the code, while also keeping the data seperate for each client.</p>
					<p>To create new clients, I developed an admin portal. The admin portal allowed me to easily create a new client by filling out a form. Once the form was filled out, a database and database user were created for the client. <strong>By creating a database user for the clients with only the necessary privileges, the system was more secure.</strong></p><br>

					<h2>Database Design and MySQL</h2>
					<p>Before this project, I only had a little experience with MySQL. To make Synkros as dynamic as possible, the code relied heavily on the database. The database was <strong>designed to be flexible</strong>, to allow Synkros to be as dynamic as possible. By allowing different settings to be stored in the database, it would allow different clients to use the system differently.</p>
					<p>At the start of the project, MySQL was very new to me. I learned a lot of SQL along the way. The biggest challenge was allowing <strong>MySQL events</strong> to be set and altered on a per client basis. It was a great learning experience and really strengthened my knowledge of MySQL.</p>

					<h2>Development</h2>
					<p>The development process included both front-end and back-end work. The UI was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. To save time on development, we purchased a template, which I then altered to be more altered to use PHP. <strong>Cross browser compatability</strong> was something I needed to stay aware of as well. I fixed multiple issues where Synkros didn't work properly across browsers.</p>
					<p>For <strong>version control</strong>, I utilized GitHub. Synkros went through extensize testing before deploying to clients. I made sure that any possible hole in the program was fixed before deploying. However, if I client ran into an issue, version control easily allowed us to rollback to a stable build</p>

						<p>Synkros was a huge learning process for me. It allowed me to develop my PHP and MySQL knowledge, as well as get a further understanding of the front-end aspect. Creating a client facing application gave me an appreciation of how much work goes into an application. It showed me the importance of creating an <strong>intuitive application</strong> and how important extensive QA is. Creating a client facing application from start to finish is something I am extremely proud of. I learned a lot during the development process while meeting deadlinesThis project really pushed me to become <strong>a better developer</strong>. This experience will allow me to create even better applications in the future.</p>
